This website was created to teach proper techniques of the three powerlifting movements: squat, bench, and deadlift. Unlike typical workouts, which usually focuses on asthetics and general health, powerlifting is intended to lift the maximum weight possible, highly taking technique into account. Using the interactive demo, you can progress through different points in the lift (shown with an image) and see what each body part is doing, how it's activated, and what muscle is being activated. Additionally, as you progress to a new stage of your current lift, elements will appear to help point out what is changing so that you can replicate the movements in the real world!

In the Powerlifting Visualizer, users will be able to:
-click on squat, bench, and deadlift sections 
-scroll/shuffle/click through different stages of the lift
-hover over different body parts to read over what that part is doing
-this feature may or may not be incorporated: include a clicker on the image of what will happen if a certain body part shifts out of alignment.
-this feature may or may not be incorporporated: include a quiz which asks the user whats wrong with a certain position in the lift, rewarding them with a flashy feature if they win.


Wireframes: Image of my project structure is located at powerlifting_visualizer2.png in the same folder as this README
![Screenshot](powerlifting_visualizer.png)


Other aspects:
The readme will be the same as the first paragraph. I may or may not add in a functionality of having the readme scroll from the left into view as the user scrolls down.

Technologies: I will mainly be using vanilla DOM javascript, webpack, npm, and canvas. If I do decide to incorporate libraries, it will be if I finish my project ahead of time. and decide to add powerlifting facts into the project.

Schedule:
Friday: Collect all pictures and get pictures showing up on the website. Also figure out how to change from one picture to the next with the use of a slider/button
Saturday-Sunday: Create hover elements for each picture, showcasing possibly different colors for different types of information presented on the image.
Mon-Wednesday: Focus on CSS styling with making pretty fonts, good background, perhaps fancy scrolling features
If done early, possibly incorporate some sort of quiz interactivity, but no solid ideas yet.
Thursday: Deploy github page.
