# Powerlifting Visualizer
Powerlifting website that teaches proper form and muscular utilization during powerlifting movements.
[Visit Live Site](https://apodavonov3616.github.io/powerlifting-visualizer/)

This website was created to teach lifting techniques on the three powerlifting movements: squat, bench, and deadlift. As a powerlifter, I have extensive knowledge on the sport and have created both the images and the data in order to show how a person should lift for best results. Unlike bodybuilding, which focuses on muscle mass increase, powerlifting focuses on strength gains above all else. Using the interactive demo, you can progress through different points in the lift (shown with an image) and take note of useful tips of each movement, as well as the level of muscular utilization! 

## In the Powerlifting Visualizer, users will be able to:
- Click on squat, bench, and deadlift sections 
- Click through different stages of the lift
- Hover over the picture to see the tips recommended at the current portion of the lift

This demo utilizes vanilla javascript, HTML, CSS, D3.js, webpack, and canvas. The data and images were created by myself.
